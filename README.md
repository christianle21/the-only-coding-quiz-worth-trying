I  tried to replicate the example for the assignment shown as best as I can. I did some liberties to make it more unique but overall, it's pretty similar to the example shown for the assignment. I did the best I could do to do this on my own albeit I did get some help from a friend for the javascript part of the assignment. I want to get to the point where I can do this all on my own but I know there's no shame in getting a little help. All in all, I am proud of my work on this.
